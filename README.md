🏠 **House Price Prediction using Machine Learning:**
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts house prices based on various features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, construction year, and location (statezip). The model is trained using Linear Regression and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.
The project covers the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering using one-hot encoding, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

⚙️ **Tech Stack Used:**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Pickle
Google Colab (for model training)
