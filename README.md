🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts house prices based on various features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, construction year, and location (statezip). The model is trained using Linear Regression and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.
The project covers the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering using one-hot encoding, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
